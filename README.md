# VanillaMinecraftWorlds
Repository for backups of vanilla Minecraft worlds.

Go to a different branch (on the top left) to select the world you want.

After that, go to Code>Download ZIP to get a zipped file with the world folder inside of it.
(The world folder ITSELF that you use should be in the same folder as a README.md file)
